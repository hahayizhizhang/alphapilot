## <mark style="color:green;">III. How to Choose Your Strategy?</mark>

When selecting a strategy, consider these factors:

1. **Risk Tolerance**\
   How much volatility can your capital handle? Higher risk means higher potential returns, while lower risk offers more stable returns.
2. **Investment Goals**\
   Are you aiming for short-term gains or long-term stable growth?
3. **Trading Instruments**\
   Do you primarily trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, or other assets?
4. **Market Volatility**\
   Is the current market highly volatile or relatively stable? Different strategies suit different market conditions.

## <mark style="color:green;">IV. What Are the Risks?</mark>

While quantitative strategies are efficient, they come with the following risks:

1. **Model Failure Risk**\
   Strategies based on historical data may fail when market conditions change.
2. **Market Volatility**\
   Strategies may not handle extreme market movements well, such as during financial crises or major policy changes.
3. **Regulatory Risk**\
   Changes in market regulations may impact strategy performance.
4. **Data Latency and Quality**\
   Delayed or inaccurate data may lead to lagged or incorrect trading signals.

For example, failing to account for sudden major events (like NFP data or central bank meetings) can pose significant risks.

_Note: Past performance does not guarantee future results. Regular monitoring and strategy adjustment are necessary to adapt to market changes._
