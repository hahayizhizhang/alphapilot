## <mark style="color:$success;">Ⅰ.</mark> **multi-factor quantitative strategy**

AlphaPilot adopts a <mark style="color:$success;">**multi-factor quantitative strategy**</mark>, which is a very common approach in quantitative investing. The core idea is to <mark style="color:$success;">**simultaneously utilize multiple proven investment factors**</mark> to construct a portfolio, thereby improving the stability of returns and reducing the risk of a single factor failing.

***

#### 1. **What is a “Factor”?**

In quantitative investing, a _factor_ is a characteristic variable used to explain or predict asset returns, typically extracted from financial data, market prices, or macroeconomic indicators.

* **Common Types of Factors**
  * **Value Factor**: e.g., low Price-to-Earnings ratio (PE), low Price-to-Book ratio (PB).
  * **Momentum Factor**: stocks with strong recent performance and upward trends.
  * **Quality Factor**: companies with high ROE, low leverage, and stable profitability.
  * **Volatility Factor**: stocks with low volatility, generally associated with lower risk.
  * **Size Factor**: excess return characteristics associated with small-cap or large-cap stocks.

***

#### 2. **Why Use “Multi-Factor”?**

* A single factor may underperform or fail during certain periods (e.g., value stocks underperforming growth stocks in some years).
* Different factors perform differently under various market conditions.
* Combining multiple factors diversifies risk and enhances the long-term robustness of the strategy.\
  It’s like not putting all your eggs in one basket—using multiple stock selection criteria together.

***

#### 3. **Process of Building a Multi-Factor Strategy**

1. **Factor Selection & Testing**
   * Select effective factors from historical data and perform significance tests (IC, t-statistics, etc.).
2. **Factor Standardization**
   * Since factors have different units of measurement, apply standardization (e.g., Z-score).
3. **Factor Weighting**
   * Assign equal weights, IC-based weights, or use machine learning methods for dynamic weighting.
4. **Stock Scoring & Ranking**
   * Calculate a composite score for each stock.
5. **Portfolio Construction & Rebalancing**
   * Select the top N stocks by score to form the portfolio, and rebalance periodically (e.g., monthly).

***

#### 4. **Advantages**

* Reduces the risk of a single factor failing.
* Delivers more stable long-term returns.
* Can adapt to different market styles.

***

#### 5. **Disadvantages**

* Factors may be highly correlated (multicollinearity), reducing diversification benefits.
* Data quality and factor stability are critical.
* Transaction costs and slippage may erode part of the returns.
